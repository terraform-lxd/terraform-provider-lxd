# terraform-provider-incus

Incus Resource provider for Terraform

## Prerequisites

- [Terraform](http://terraform.io)
- [Incus](https://linuxcontainers.org/incus)

## Installation

This provider is published in the [Terraform Registry](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/terraform-incus/incus/).

Follow the official instructions for declaring providers in your Terraform configuration
[here](https://www.terraform.io/docs/configuration/provider-requirements.html).

### Quick Example

Add the following to your Terraform configuration:

```hcl
terraform {
  required_providers {
    incus = {
      source = "maveonair/incus"
    }
  }
}
```

### Development

#### Setup

1. Follow these [instructions](https://golang.org/doc/install) to setup a Golang development environment.
2. Checkout the repository `git clone ...`
3. Compile from sources to a development binary:

```shell
cd terraform-provider-incus
go build -v
```

4. Configure Terraform (`~/.terraformrc`) to use the development binary provider:

```shell
$ cat ~/.terraformrc
provider_installation {
  dev_overrides {
    "maveonair/incus" = "/home/<REPLACE_ME>/git/terraform-provider-incus"
  }
}
```

#### Testing

There are two test suites, unit and acceptance. By default the acceptance tests are not run as they require a functional
Incus environment.

##### Unit tests

```shell
make
```

##### Acceptance tests

```shell
make acc
# or run an individual test
TESTARGS="-run TestAccCachedImage_basicVM" make testacc
# increase test verbosity. options are trace, debug, info, warn, or error (default)
TF_LOG=info make testacc
```

## Documentation

Full documentation can be found in the [`docs`](docs) directory.

## Known Limitations

Many of the base Incus images don't include an SSH server, therefore terraform
will be unable to execute any `provisioners`. Either use the base ubuntu images
from the `ubuntu` or `ubuntu-daily` or manually prepare a base image that
includes SSH.
