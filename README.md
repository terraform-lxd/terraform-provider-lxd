LXD Resource provider for Terraform

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/sl1pm4t/terraform-provider-lxd.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/sl1pm4t/terraform-provider-lxd)

## Prerequisites

* [Terraform](http://terraform.io)
* [LXD](https://linuxcontainers.org/lxd)

## Usage

This provider connects to the LXD daemon over local Unix socket or HTTPS.

It makes use of the [LXD client library](http://github.com/lxc/lxd), which currently looks in `~/.config/lxc/` for `client.crt` and `client.key` files that must exist to be able to communicate with the LXD daemon.

To generate these files and store them in the LXD daemon, follow these [steps](https://linuxcontainers.org/lxd/getting-started-cli/#multiple-hosts).

### Example Configurations

#### Provider (HTTPS)

```hcl
provider "lxd" {
  scheme  = "https"
  address = "10.1.1.8"
  remote  = "lxd-server"
}
```

#### Basic Example

This assumes the LXD server has been configured per the LXD documentation, including running `lxd init` to create a default network configuration.

This example also assumes an image called `ubuntu` has been cached locally on the LXD server. This can be done by running:

```shell
$ lxc image copy images:ubuntu/xenial/amd64 local: --alias=ubuntu
```

With those pieces in place, you can launch a basic container with:

```hcl
resource "lxd_container" "test1" {
  name      = "test1"
  image     = "ubuntu"
  ephemeral = false
}
```

A container can also take a number of configuration and device options. A full reference can be found [here](https://github.com/lxc/lxd/blob/master/doc/configuration.md). For example, to create a container with 2 CPUs and to share the `/tmp` directory with the LXD host:

```hcl
resource "lxd_container" "test1" {
  name      = "test1"
  image     = "ubuntu"
  ephemeral = false

  config {
    limits.cpu = 2
  }

  device {
    name = "shared"
    type = "disk"

    properties {
      source = "/tmp"
      path   = "/tmp"
    }
  }
}
```

#### Profiles

Profiles can be used to share common configurations between containers. Profiles accept the same configuration and device options that containers can use.

The order which profiles are specified is important. LXD applies profiles from "left to right", so profile options may be overridden by other profiles.

```hcl
resource "lxd_profile" "profile1" {
  name = "profile1"

  config {
    limits.cpu = 2
  }

  device {
    name = "shared"
    type = "disk"

    properties {
      source = "/tmp"
      path   = "/tmp"
    }
  }
}

resource "lxd_container" "test1" {
  name      = "test1"
  image     = "ubuntu"
  ephemeral = false
  profiles  = ["default", "${lxd_profile.profile1.name}"]
}
```

#### Networks

If you're using LXD 2.3 or later, you can create networks with the `lxd_network` resource. See [this](https://www.stgraber.org/2016/10/27/network-management-with-lxd-2-3/) blog post for details about LXD networking and the [configuration reference](https://github.com/lxc/lxd/blob/master/doc/configuration.md) for all network details.

This example creates a standard NAT network similar to what `lxd init` creates. Containers will access this network via their `eth0` interface:

```hcl
resource "lxd_network" "new_default" {
  name = "new_default"

  config {
    ipv4.address = "10.150.19.1/24"
    ipv4.nat     = "true"
    ipv6.address = "fd42:474b:622d:259d::1/64"
    ipv6.nat     = "true"
  }
}

resource "lxd_profile" "profile1" {
  name = "profile1"

  device {
    name = "eth0"
    type = "nic"

    properties {
      nictype = "bridged"
      parent  = "${lxd_network.new_default.name}"
    }
  }
}

resource "lxd_container" "test1" {
  name      = "test1"
  image     = "ubuntu"
  ephemeral = false
  profiles  = ["${lxd_profile.profile1.name}"]
}
```

This example creates a second internal network that containers will access via `eth1`. Containers will use the `default` profile to gain access to the default network on `eth0`.

```hcl
resource "lxd_network" "internal" {
  name = "internal"

  config {
    ipv4.address = "192.168.255.1/24"
  }
}

resource "lxd_profile" "profile1" {
  name = "profile1"

  device {
    name = "eth1"
    type = "nic"

    properties {
      nictype = "bridged"
      parent  = "${lxd_network.internal.name}"
    }
  }
}

resource "lxd_container" "test1" {
  name      = "test1"
  image     = "ubuntu"
  ephemeral = false
  profiles  = ["default", "${lxd_profile.profile1.name}"]

	provisioner "local-exec" {
		command = "lxc exec local:${self.name} dhclient eth1"
	}
}
```

Finally, LXD networks can be used to create tunnels to other LXD servers. In order to create a tunnel, designate one LXD server as the tunnel "server". This server will offer DHCP leases to the tunnel "client". For example:

```hcl
resource "lxd_network" "vxtun" {
  name = "vxtun"

  config {
    tunnel.vxtun.protocol = "vxlan"
    tunnel.vxtun.id       = 9999
    tunnel.vxtun.local    = "10.1.1.1"
    tunnel.vxtun.remote   = "10.255.1.1"
    ipv4.address          = "192.168.255.1/24"
    ipv6.address          = "none"
  }
}
```

For the tunnel client:

```hcl
resource "lxd_network" "vxtun" {
  name = "vxtun"

  config {
    tunnel.vxtun.protocol = "vxlan"
    tunnel.vxtun.id       = 9999
    tunnel.vxtun.local    = "10.255.1.1"
    tunnel.vxtun.remote   = "10.1.1.1"
    ipv4.address          = "none"
    ipv6.address          = "none"
  }
}
```

Note how the `local` and `remote` addresses are swapped between the two. Also note how the client does not provide an IP address range.

With these resources in place, attach them to a profile in the exact same way described in the other examples.

_note_: `local` and `remote` accept both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses.

## Known Limitations

All the base LXD images do not include an SSH server, therefore terraform will be unable to execute any `provisioners`.
A basic base image must be prepared in advance, that includes the SSH server.

## To Do

- [ ] Support for using client cert / key from other paths
- [ ] Ability to update container config
- [ ] Ability to exec commands via LXD WebSocket channel
- [ ] Ability to upload files via LXD WebSocket channel
- [ ] Volumes support
- [ ] Add LXD `image` resource
